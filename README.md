# Diduenjoy - API V1 Documentation

## API V1 Reference

The Diduenjoy API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/).
Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

> ### API Endpoint
> 
> ``` http://api.diduenjoy.com/api/v1 ```

## Authentication

You authenticate to the Diduenjoy API by providing your secret API key in the request.
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secret!

> ### API keys
> 
> You can find and generate your API keys in the API tab in your Diduenjoy dashboard settings.
> ![api keys in diduenjoy dahsboard settings](http://api.diduenjoy.com/api-key-screenshot.png)

Authentication to the API occurs via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username. You do not need to provide a password.


> ### Example Request
> 
> ```bash
> curl 'http://api.diduenjoy.com/api/v1/surveys' \
>  -u 'PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE:'
>  ```
> 
> curl uses the -u flag to pass basic auth credentials (adding a colon after your API key will prevent it from asking you for a password).
